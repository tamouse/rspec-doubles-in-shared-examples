# Ruby Learning Samples Skeleton

This provides a basic directory structure and minimal set of gems I
like to use while creating tiny learning projects for myself. (See
[practicing rails] for a more complete exegis on how to learn.)

## Installation

Clone the repository to where you want to create a learning sample:

    $ git clone https://github.com/tamouse/ruby-learning-sample-skeleton.git my_new_sample

Reset or remove the github origin (you don't want it pointing back at the skeleton):

    $ git remote rm origin
    $ git remote add origin <my_remote_repo>

## Usage

Update the `README.md` file to reflect your learning goals and
outcomes. A sample is located at `sample-README.md`.

## Contributing

The usual: "fork it, branch it, code it, test it, PR it."

1. Fork the repository at <https://github.com/tamouse/ruby-learning-sample-skeleton>.
2. Create a branch with your changes.
3. Make and test your changes.
4. Push your changes to your fork.
5. Submit a PR to <https://github.com/tamouse/ruby-learning-sample-skeleton/pulls>
