## What I want to do?

See if doubles can be used inside RSpec's shared examples.

## Why I want to do it?
 
Shared examples are something I've not explored much, and this
question was asked in #rubyonrails on irc.freenode.net.

## What it means if I could do it?
 
I'd probably use shared examples more, which would save on writing
code for tests.

## What stops me from doing it?

I haven't thought about it before.

## What it means that I can't do it

Nothing much different than what I'm doing now

## What I've tried, and what happened

I've used doubles a lot, but not with shared examples.
