# Learning README Sample

Copy this to your learning sample's README.md and fill in the
following areas (lifted liberally from Pat Maddox's esteemable
[RubySteps 101]):

## What I want to do?

I need SOME idea of what I'm trying to do, right?

## Why I want to do it?
 
If I can find some different way of getting what I want, then I can consider that as an alternative.

## What it means if I could do it?
 
Then I could do what I REALLY want - which gives me motivation to figure something out.

## What stops me from doing it?

I have a perceived set of limitations to work within. If I get
explicit about those limitations upfront, I can use them
creatively. If I don't, they can box me in and prevent me from
accomplishing my goals.

## What it means that I can't do it

I can't do what I want, and that sucks, and now I feel stuck.

## What I've tried, and what happened

What were the outcomes, what was learned, what was surprising, what
will I do with it?
